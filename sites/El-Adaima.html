      <h1>El Adaima</h1>
      <h3>Pre-Dynastic Period-Second Dynasty Period</h3>
	  <h4>Arielle Elyse Creps</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>El-Adaima is an archaeological site that resides within Egypt on the Western bank on the Nile river. The site mainly consists of a small settlement area, agricultural area, and lastly a cemetery. The site is said to specifically revolve around the Pre-Dynastic to the Second Dynasty period. While the site is not predominantly important to archaeologists based upon grand civilizations, the site holds information on funerary practices, containing two separate graveyards. As well, archaeologists have been able to thoroughly investigate the undergrowth that was present during this time period. </p>

	<h3>Regional and Geographical Setting</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The site of el-Adaima is located on the West bank of the Nile, approximately 8kilometers south of the city of Esna in Egypt. As well, the site is 30kilometers North of the city of Hierakonpolis.  The site consists of a cemetery that has been thoroughly ransacked, and a settlement, which spans about 1kilometer and is known to be littered with artifacts.  In 1989, the French Institute of Cairo initiated excavations of the remains of the site under the dig direction of Beatrix Midant-Reynes.   According to the finds at this excavation, it was discovered that the civilization had migrated from the desert into the valley region sometime between the Pre-Dynastic and Early Dynastic periods, insinuating an increased complexity of the civilization. </p>

	 <h3>Site Description</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>In terms of the site description, el-Adaima spans a diverse area consisting of sandy, desert conditions to a valley where much of the excavations have taken place. There is a Western cemetery site that mainly contains badly damaged sites, the Eastern cemetery filled with many children graves, and a settlement that is now scattered with a plethora of artifacts edged by cultivated land.  The region is mildly populated with vegetation currently, but during Pre-Dynastic periods is said to have been more densely populated with flora according to archaeological research. </p>

	<h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The site was discovered by the archaeologist Henri de Morgan around the beginning of the 20th century, and is said to have excavated the majority of the site and be the responsible party for the pillaging of the cemetery.  While Morgan’s techniques were questionable at the least, he did uncover numerous artifacts that are now housed in the Brooklyn Museum. Among these discoveries are a large number of ceramic vessels deposited into the graves within the cemetery.  Inside were discovered animal remains along with remnants of beer and bread.  According to Gaelle Breand in a piece he wrote for the British Museum’s publication, “the corpus of pre-firing marks and the vessels associated with them are peculiar in comparison with those known from other sites. In Adaima, open and closed vessel forms bear pot-marks that can be similar; the most striking fact is that these vessels are made from various fabrics, thereby suggesting different levels of pottery production,” with materials ranging from Marl clay to ones made of silt and straw.  This sophistication in pottery making, predominantly discovered in funerary context makes the whole ceremony of death appear of the greatest of importance in Adaima. 
Perhaps most intriguingly is the statement made by the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology is that, “Almost 1000 Pre-Dynastic graves have been excavated, dating from the mid-late 4000 BCE, including a perfectly preserved children’s cemetery. The excavation of the Adaima necropolis has completely re-assessed the funeral practices of this period. It has provided new evidence for the establishment of the State and the emergence of writing in Egypt.” “The practice of killing and depositing the dead in accompaniment burials has been the focus of numerous studies” and incorporates the importance of pottery to the region as well with the “appearance of the representation by a deformed vase of a humpback suffering from tuberculosis.” 

In terms of the change of vegetation after the shift from the desert to the valley, “previous results from charcoal analyses at two Upper Egyptian sites, Adaïma and Elkab, did not yield strong evidence of a vegetation change at the end of the Pre-Dynastic period). Only very slight changes could be perceived. However, difficulties in dating the settlement contexts at Adaïma may have contributed to blur the temporal differences in the composition and the structure of the woody vegetation,” according to Claire Newton and dig director Beatrix Midant-Reynes.  Midant-Reynes continues on in her report stating that, “the occupation of Adaïma covers more than 700 years, (spanning the Pre-Dynastic to the Second Dynasty). 
The settlement area studied concerns both the northern terrace, from which charcoal data have already been published and the sandy plain to the south of that terrace,” making the site incredibly diverse in both landscape and archaeology terms.  By executing thorough charcoal analyses, Midant-Reynes states that archaeologists are able to tell what it was like for, “inhabitants of Adaïma in the early fourth millennium BC,” particularly in regards to the vegetation.  “The woody vegetation was probably more extensive than today, in particular at the desert margin, as the abundance of xerophilous taxa indicate. The main plant formations were dominated by tamarisks and acacia, and it is possible that tamarisk copses covered part of the sandy plain within the settlement.”  This evidence allows archaeologists to better understand the living conditions that the people of el-Adaima would have been experiencing and the resources that were potentially at their disposable.

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>In conclusion, it is without saying that the predominance of importance to archaeology at the site of el-Adaima is the two cemeteries, which are at the site. These cemeteries, with one being completely looted and the other, for the most part, well preserved, give insight not only into the people of Adaima and their funerary practices, but as well, to the advancements that have taken places in the field of archaeological excavation. Funerary pottery seems to be of great importance to the region with a multitude of styles with varying degrees of difficulty having been discovered in the region. As well, the vegetation in el-Adaima through careful analyses of charcoal remains tells of the plentiful growth that was dominate of the valley region during the Pre-Dynastic era, and gives archaeologists a more realistic mode in recreating the history of the site.</p>
